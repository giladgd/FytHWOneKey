## How does it work?
*(Upon install the package installer will probably mention that it can not check the app, so it thinks that it might not be safe to install.That is of course for you to decide ;)<br>Upon install the app buttons are configured for the apps that are normally started by the button)*<br>
1. Open the "Fyt HW OneKey" App and configure the preferred app by its package name.

**General Configuration screen**<br>

<br>
**Specify the apk by package name**<br>
*(Here in the "Configure the Media Button")*<br>

<br>
2. Exit the app. This is important otherwise the key capture does not work correctly!<br>
3. Press the hardware button on your unit.<br>
4. The first time you press the hardware button, for example the Media button, it will present you with 2 options: Complete action with "Music Player" or "FYT HW OneKey Media button". If you select the second option, you will get the option "Once" and "Always".
